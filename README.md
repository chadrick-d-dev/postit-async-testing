# Testing Review


## Instructions:
This app is meant to be a playground for testing. The implementation code is all written out, and there are empty it blocks in test files. 

Your goal is to fill out all the it blocks with appropriate tests. If prompted, you should be able to explain why we're testing a certain feature as described by the it blocks.
